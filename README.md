## Decentralized Ad Network - Gateway to Web3 ad's

Decentralized Ad Network is here to ensure that these major businesses donâ€™t also establish their duopoly in web3. We serve as the link between advertisements and DAPPS. We offer data to the advertiser with creative intelligence so they may run more effective campaigns for less money. We provide as the entry point for DAPPs to be monetized with advertisements and analysis technologies to ensure that nobody gets inundated with unrelated adverts.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, AntD

**Server:** Express, Node, PostgreSQL, Solidity, Push, Polygon, Dune, The Graph


## Usage

### Polygon:
As our whole app is data heavy and each ad that gets published, we have to create a transaction. So our ad-related smart contract is deployed on polygon and all ad-related transactions will be via polygon.
#### Smart contract : https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xe0deF8B610b462668d131bfAaa52aB7eab89A5d3

### Dune:

The whole ad world depends upon the user persona. Target audience is one of the biggest factors for a successful ad campaign. So using Dune we are accessing all the previous transactions and address holdings. We have built SDK over the dune to get address id and fetch data and accordingly we run queries and using them we return the user persona. Over that user persona, all the ads are fetched and it gets to the user. So Dune is acting like a data partner and we are accessing it with our own SDK
### Push:
For each campaign, the advertiser will get a custom notification for all the data related to the ads, spends, clicks, and impressions. With the help of push notification advertiser will be notified of all the details and will be able to review and optimize the campaign.

### The Graph:

Our concept requires a lot of data, thus every time a user connects, we must fetch data. So it can be quite inundated to fetch directly from chains. Since the subgraph indexes the data, it facilitates our work and enables us to retrieve accurate data at a remarkable rate.
